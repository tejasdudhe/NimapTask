## ‚úÖ Feedback Implementation from Nimap InfoTech

As per the feedback received:

> ‚ùó"While fetching single product details, the response should be populated with respective category details."

This has been implemented using the following field in the `Product` entity:

```java
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
@JoinColumn(name = "categID")
@JsonIgnoreProperties("products")
private Category category;

//This maps your Product to a Category, and due to FetchType.EAGER, it ensures category is automatically fetched when you get a product.
